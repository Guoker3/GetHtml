web url should be in the form of https://.... /

dataset:
    Raw2:  type of CSV with one-line head,haven't completely normalized.

data reflect:
    for convinience ,just use data natualy a percent,and leave complex reflect later,you can do it with an independently class to avoid the information loss when format the dataset.(attention:the realistic feature connection between element and canvas is a hand-made work,because the web is similiar with the canvas but not is .that also means that data and rules both can be get in other way.)
